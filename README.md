# Titanic Survival Prediction Using R

### Introduction
As a **beginner** of ML and DL, I tried to find a very basic project that you can do.  
I came across the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition from Kaggle.  
Since I do not have any experience with Python, I decided to use R to predict the survivors using R.  
Therefore, Titanic Survival Prediction Using R begins.  


### Steps
1. Imported train & test data sets
2. Merge two data sets and clean them up  
(ex. dealing with missing values)
3. Split the datas to begin building a model  
4. (Cross Validation or some sort of a estimation, but I didn't do this part)
5. Build a model
6. Run the model using test data set


### FYI
In the original data sets, one of variables is "Sex".  
Since I use R code in Colab, I needed to import the data sets into my Google Drive.  
But, because of the name of the variable, Google decied to flag the data sets.  
So, I manually changed the variable to "Gender".  
(I'm not sure if others had the same issue)
